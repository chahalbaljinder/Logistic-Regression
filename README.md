Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification. It predicts the probability that a given input belongs to one of two classes. Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression predicts discrete outcomes by mapping the input values to probabilities using a logistic function.


Steps to Train Logistic Regression Model:

Initialize Parameters:
Start with initial guesses for the coefficients Î².

Compute Predictions:
For each training example, compute the predicted probability using the logistic function.

Compute Cost:
Evaluate the cost function using the predicted probabilities and the actual labels.

Update Parameters:
Adjust the parameters using gradient descent to reduce the cost.

Iterate:
Repeat the process of computing predictions, evaluating the cost, and updating parameters until the model converges (i.e., the changes in the cost function are below a certain threshold).
